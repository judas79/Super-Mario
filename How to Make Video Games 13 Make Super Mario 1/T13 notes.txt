Make Super Mario BrothersIn this video tutorial we start making a Super Mario Clone!!! I’ll cover Pixel Art with Gimp, 
Sprites, Setting up a New Game, Cleaning up Images, Slicing Sprite Sheets, Designing Scenes, Tracking Chracters with a Camera, and Much More.

All of the code used follows the video below. Here is a link to all the Sounds and Images I use in this series.

****************** setup folders and save MainScene ***************************

After downloading or building the project files, we will add our empty folders to assets, inside of Unity.

Assets:

Animations
Prefabs
Scenes
Scripts
Sounds 
Sprites

Then go to 'save scene', 'save project' the we will '.
Then we will save the Scene inside the 'Hierarchy ...' 3 dots, Then click 'save scene as' and save as,
'MainScene' inside the Assets, Scenes folder.

Next drag all the Sprites from the folder that they are stored in, into the Sprites folder, in Unity.
There should be 16 sprites total.

***************** setup Sprites **********************

Select all the sprites, and in settings set to:
pixels per unit = 32
filter mode = Point
Click apply, at the bottom of the settings.

Next, highlight our Manny group of Sprites, and change the setting:
Compression = High Quality
then Apply

We will do the same thing for:
BrickBlock
Coin
Bee1
Bee2

Next we will split up our Manny sprite sheet.
Select it, Then change these settings:
Sprite Mode = Multiple
pixels per unit  = 32

Click sprite editor then, Apply.
In the editor click the upside down triangle and choose:
Type = grid by cell size
pixel size = 32 x 32
then click slice button, then apply, then close the editor.

Check the Manny group of sprites to see that they are now sliced out.

******************* Camera, grass, fillHole, PrizeBlock, Pipe, BrickWall, Coin and bush setup ****************************

Next click the hierarchy MainCamera, and set settings to:
Size = 8
Color = #D9E8FC00 hex, sky color

Drag the grass sprite into our scene window.
Then drag the grass from the hierarchy list into our prefabs folder, 
then delete from hierarchy.
Next, drag the grass from prefab into our left bottom corner of our Main camera area, 
our Main Scene window.

Next, hierarchy, create empty, rename to Grass, the drag the Grass prefabe, that is in hierarch list,
into the Grass, object Container.
Duplicate that Grass prefab 12 times. 13 total for now
Go down each duplicate and addt 1, in the position X, from whatever the duplicate grass preceeding it was.
If Grass position X = -14 then Grass(1) position X = -13
Run it to see how much if any we need to alster our grass to the right, to cover the starting left most point of the screen.
After, compensating for the neccessary offset, to get the starting point, on your left to the edge of the games screen,
keep duplicating the grass and adding 1 to the x position until ith goes almost all the way to your right side of the playing screen.
Leave about 1/8 empty area, a hole on the right expanse of grass, to the right wall.

						 hole (no grass)
|							|	|
|							v	|
| <------- Grass ------>|		|
|_______________________________|
bottom left						bottom right wall


Next, drag in the 'FillSprite' from the Sprites folder, into the Grass object container, in the hierarchy list.
Then drag the fillSprite from the middle of our Scene Window, and place it directly below, the grass, we just completed.
Zoom in and align the fillSprite left edge with our grass edge.
Select the Rect Tool and drag our fillSprit, all the way to our right wall(camera right edge).

						 hole (no grass)
|							|	|
|							v	|
| <------- Grass ------>|		|
|_______________________________|
================================ <-- FillSprite
bottom left						bottom right wall

Next change the color of our FillSprite to #004F15 (green as the darkest shade of the green grass)

Next, create a prefab, out of the Bush, create Bushes container out of empty object container in heirarchy;  
put it in there.
Drag your Bush, the bottom left camera boreder, and align it above the grass.

						 hole (no grass)
|	|<-camera border		|	|
|	|	@<-bushes			v	|
|<0-|------- Grass ------>|		|
|___|_____________________|
================================ <-- FillSprite

Next, make a prefab out of the PrizeBlock sprite, create a empty object container renamed to PrizeBlock,
delete the PrizeBlock sprite from hierarchy list, and put the prefab PrizeBlock in the PrizeBlock container.


						 hole (no grass)
|	|<camera  #<prizebrick		|	
|	|	@<-bushes			v	|
|<0-|------- Grass ------>|		|
|___|_____________________|     |
================================ <-- FillSprite
bottom left						bottom right wall


Do the same thing for the Pipes sprite, and put it into a Pipes container.
Position it of the grid blocks background, from the left side of our camera border, and grids up, from our grass.
Put the pipe halfway of the x axis of the grass; on top of the grass.


                    v  pipe
____________________0____________________ <grass


(do the same thing as before)
Next, make a prefab out of the BrickBlock sprite, create a empty object container renamed to BrickBlock,
delete the brickblock sprite from hierarchy list, and put the prefab brickblock in the BrickBlocks container.
Put the brickblock above and to the right of the pipe, at the same height as the prizebrick.

          #prizebrick            # brickblock

                    v  pipe
____________________0____________________ <grass


next, duplicate the BrickBlock twice, then in the BrickBlock(1) position x, add 1 to it,
so that it sits to the right of the original brickblock.
Add another 2 to the position x of the second copy so it sets right next to the first copy.


          #prizebrick            ### brickblocks

                    v  pipe
____________________0____________________ <grass


Next, do the same for the Coin sprite, and name the container Coins.
Then make two duplicates of coin, and put one above each BrickBlock, 
adding 1 each time, to the duplicates to keep them evenly spaced.
Make one more duplicate and put it befor our hole, in the grass


								 ooo coins
          #prizebrick            ### brickblocks  |
												  |< right camera border
                    v  pipe                       |
____________________0____________________#__ hole |
          ^								 ^
		grass                       brickBlock


************************* setup camera tracking of Manny *****************************

Drag MannySpriteSheet(0), form sprites area, into our scene window, so we can use him to setup the camera, that will track him.
Place him on top of the grass, between the bush and the PrizeBlock, we placed earlier.
Rename him to Manny, inside hierarchy.

Next, in the Scripts folder, create new C# script, name it 'CameraMove', then double click it to go into Visual Studio,
where we will continue the comments and tutorial, within the script...

After returning from setting up our camera tracking for Manny, 
we will go select our camera, in Unity, and drag our CameraMove script into its settings.
Drag Manny from hierarchy into the 'camera target' space, that we just added,
with the CameraMoves script, into the camera settings, at the bottom.
The other CameraMoves script settings for our camera:
Camera Speed = 2.5
MinX = 0
MinY = 0
MaxX = 100
MaxY = 100

Make sure you have 'Maximize on play' turned off, in your Unity browser run options.
To test the tracking, run the game, and drag the Manny sprite towards the center of the camera area,
then to the bottom right side of the camera area, and watch that the tracking, isn't jumping,
and is smooth, in the scene window area, and the game area.
See that you can move Manny halfway upt the scene screen, before the cmera moves up at all.
Also note, that the camera doesn't move to the right, until you have crosed the midpoint of the camera area in the Scene screen window.
