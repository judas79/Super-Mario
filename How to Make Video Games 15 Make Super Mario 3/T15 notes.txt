In this part of my tutorial on how to make a Super Mario Clone we cover a ton of topics! We cover how to Fix Collision Errors, 
Fix Scene Errors, AnimationCurve, Moving the UI with the Camera, Block Collisions, Reacting to Collisions from 1 Direction, 
Exploding Brick Blocks, Coins, Sounds and More.

Like always the code follows the video below. Here are all the Images and Sounds

***************************** Fix Manny collision with unseen object *****************************

When many colliders are placed next to each other, they tend to collide with each other, because of their proximity.
To fix this, in this situation, we will select all the grass objects and fillSprite, in hierarchy, and remove the BoxCollider 2d,
from all of them.
Next, select the Grass container object and add the  BoxCollider 2d to them, that way.
Next, change the offset and size, of the BoxCollider until it surrounds all of our grass and fillSprite.
In your Scene window, select the icon that allows you to edit collider, to see the outline of the collider.
Then, Try as a starting point:
BoxCollider 2D:
size X = 27
size y = 2
Offset x = -2
offset y = -6.5

Run it to see if it works... hurray it works!


****************************** Sound Manager *****************************

First, in hierarchy create and empty object, then name it SoundManager.
Right click SoundManager, and choose Audio, Audio Source.
Next create a new script, and name it SoundManager, then double click it,
and we will continue with our notes and code, in our VS app...

After returning from creating our SoundManager script, we need to drag and drop our sound clips,
into our Sounds folder in Assets, if you haven't done so already.
Thendrag our SoundManager script into our SoundManager settings, to add it there.
Next, select your SoundManager script and drag the sounds that pertain to thier public fields, by name,
in the SoundManager script.


********************************* PrizeBlock *****************************

Next, we will make our PrizeBlock work.
Select PrizeBlock, in hierarchy, PrizeBlock container, and add a RigidBody 2d and a BoxCollider 2d, to it.
In RigidBody 2d setting, set:
Body Type = Kinetic
Kinetic, because it only moves in one way, and doesn't need to be controlled.

We will add an animation to this, so the PrizeBlock jumps up, in the script.

Next we will create another script, and name it PrizeBlock, double click it,
and continue our notes and comments within the script...

After comming back from adding our public defines, we will drag our PrizeBlock script,
into our PrizBlock, in hierarchy, prizeblock container, settings, as a component.

Within our PrizeBlock script inside our prizeblock settings, we will double click within the 'anim' field,
to edit it, to do our animation.
A box should popup, named 'curve'.  There we will use a curved line, to edit the coins, upwards movement,
and time it takes to get to the top of the curve, and the the coins falling, and time, until it hits bottom.
We want the coin to jump up quick and come down slow.

     _
    / \
   /    \
  /       \
 /           \
/                 \___

Next, we will need a UI for out PrizeBlock Coins, to keep the Score.
When the PrizeBox is hit, coins will be generated...
In Hierarchy, create a Text UI, which will also create Canvas, for it.
Rename Text to Score.

Next, select Canvas, and change the settings:
Render Mode = Screen Based Camera;  we want the UI elements to move as the camera moves.
Drag, out Main Camera from heirarchy, into the 'Render Camera' field.

Next, Click on Score, and change these settings.
Font Style = Bold
Color = 'white'

Next, select Canvas, and drag the Score text box up into the top left of your game screen.
Change the: 
Text = 0 (zero)
Font Size = 28
Height = 50

Next, drage your Score text box out of the MainCamera bounderies.  So it shows up, in the top left corner,
of your gameplay window, when you run it.  It will take some moving, to achieve the right top location desired!

Next, double click our PrizeBox script, and we will continue, making the Score and Prizebox work, there...

After returning from our script after adding the ability to run the coin animation, change the score and,
adding 'using UnityEngine.UI;' to the librarries at the to of the script, so we could manipulate the text
oject in our score, we can now test our game by running it.

Two things that might come up:
Rename, your Text UI component that you made previously, to Score, if its not already that way.
If there is no sound, and you get a audio null type error, insure that you added your SoundManager script to the Audio Source,
inside the SoundManger container in your hierarchy, and that the sound clips where added to thier corresponding fields.

Next increade the Size of our Score:
Scale x and y  = 2
Re-orient the Score Text, in the gameplay screen, as needed.

If your Scene goes grey, while you are zooming in and our, right click, above our sceen screen area,
where it says #Scene then choose Add tab, then Scene, then go to the same place, and choose close tab,
to close the scene.


*********************************** BrickBlocks **************************************

First, we will add a boxcollider2d to both types of BrickBlock, and BrickBlocks, in our hierarchy, so select all ot them.
Add, a Boxcollider 2d to them all.

Next we will set it up so that if any of these BrickBlocks, are hit at the bottom, by Manny, they will explode.
We will add the explodedBlock Sprite to our BrickBlocks for that effect, later.

Next, we will create a new Script, and name it BrickBlock, and double click it to launch it in VS.
Then select all 3 of the BrickBlocks, with coins on top of them; the ones Manny will be jumping up into,
to dislodge the coins.
Drag the BrickBlock script into the setting of those 3 selected BrickBlock objects, in the settings area.

Next, double click the Brickblock script and we will continue our notes and code in  VS...

After returning from setting up our BrickBlock script and the transition from the brickblock,
to the explodedblock animation, we will select those same three coin on top, BrickBlocks, in hierarchy.
Then drag our ExplodedBlock, from the sprites folder, into the explodedBlock field, in the setting, BrickBlock script, area.

run the game, and see if the BrickBlocks, explode when manny jumps, and hits the bottom of them,
with his head.
Success!


*************************************** Coins ****************************************


First, select all 3 Coins, in hierarchy.
Add a CircleCollider 2d to those.  The same thing as a boxcollider, but a circle around the edge.

Next create a Script and name it Coin.
Double click the Coin script and add this DL:
// Needed to manipulate the UI
using UnityEngine.UI;
and continue notes and code in VS...

After returning from setting up our coin collisions and scoring, for them,
Select the 3 coins in hierarchy, the drag the Coin Script, into thier settings.
run the game to see that it all works.
